Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## Authentication and First Admin Setup

1. **Registration**: New users can create an account via the Sign Up form. The supplied name is stored in Supabase user metadata.
2. **Login / Logout**: Use the Sign In form to authenticate and the Sign Out option to end the session. Authentication state is provided by `AuthContext` and integrates with Supabase.
3. **Creating the First Admin**: When no `national` users exist, an authenticated user can promote themselves to the first administrator. The app calls the `create_first_admin` Supabase function which sets the user's role to `national` and creates the profile record if needed.
4. **Managing Admin Users**: Admin status and user lists are fetched through the new `adminService` and related hooks.

These steps ensure the full authentication flow from initial admin creation through regular user registration and login.

## Offline caching strategy

The service worker in `public/sw.js` pre-caches only the app shell and manifest
while other static assets are cached at runtime. Navigation requests use a
network-first approach and fall back to the cached `/` page when offline.
Scripts, styles, images and fonts generated by Vite are stored as they are
requested, so hashed filenames work automatically. API responses and other
sensitive data are deliberately excluded from the cache. The `CACHE_VERSION`
constant controls cache invalidation; incrementing it clears old caches on the
next activation.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following keys:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-supabase-publishable-key>
```

These variables configure the Supabase client used by the application.
